## Notes for the BackEnd Development

### Practice to Follow -
1. Never Upload the environment variable or sensitive information in the GitHub.

2. Comment the code with necessary information may required by others or yourselves latter.
 
3. Commit and Push the code with proper message so other can understand as well.
     
4. Use the given file structure to make code more modular so that it may be reusable in future.

### Running the code :
Please fetch the latest code prior to the development and install the required dependencies. The .env file will be provided separately for the development by the admin. You just have to use that file in your local machine for development.

```bash
cd BackEnd
npm install
npm run dev
```
